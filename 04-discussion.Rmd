# Discussion

You should use the reliability coefficients we suggest.

## Some notes:

the _bookdown.yml file lets you pick which .Rmds are compiled within a directory and in which order. If you do not create this file, all .Rmds will be compiled in alphabetical order.

The "master" file MUST be named index.Rmd

A separate references .Rmd is not needed. Just place the header at the end of the discussion for the same effect.
