# Discussion

You should use the reliability coefficients we suggest.

Some notes:

the _bookdown.yml file lets you pick which .Rmds are compiled within a directory and in which order.

There does not need to be a separate .Rmd for references and the References header does not need to be put at the end of the discussion. They are added automatically by bookdown.

The "master" file MUST be named index.Rmd
